Build a web application CRUD operation using .NET/.NET Core & MVC framework (bootstrap 5). You have to design a web form and show data in a data table. Web form data will be saved into a database (SQL Server) and Data table data will be shown from the database. Design can be done in its own way. Here is the description of the form. 

|**Form Field Name** |**Input Type** |**Description** |
| - | - | - |
|*ID NUMBER* |Number |Mandatory field. |
|*Name* |Text |Mandatory field |
|*Division* |Select |Mandatory field |
|*Department* |Select |Mandatory field |
|*Date of Birth* |Date picker |Mandatory field |
|*Resume upload* |File |Mandatory field |

- **ID NUMBER** input number field. Mandatory field. Length 8 digits fixed. 
- **Name** input text field. Mandatory field. 
- **Division and department dropdown** will have a cascade relation e.g. if we select a division then the respective department of that division should be loaded in the department dropdown. Division and department are given to the following database. 
-  **Date of Birth** will be a date picker. Mandatory field. Need to validate the valid data string. 
- **Resume upload** can be done with file upload. Need to be validated that only PDF and DOC files are allowed to be uploaded. The file will upload and save to a folder of the application and the file path will be saved in the database. 
- **Save data** in the following database and the table is already given there. 

|**IP ADDRESS** |**USERNAME** |**PASSWORD** |**SERVICE NAME** |
| - | - | - | - |
|XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX |XXXXXXXX |XXXXXXXXXXXX |XX |

Data table data will be loaded from database table. Here is the Data table example and description: 

|**ID NUMBER** |**NAME** |**DIVISION** |**Department** |**Date of Birth** |**Age** |**Resume** |**Action** |
| - | - | - | - | :- | - | - | - |
|10000001 |Ashraful Alam |IT |Software |07-Sep- 2020 |23 years 0 month 0 days |File1 |View Edit delete |

- **In the data table** the resume file name needs to be clickable and after clicking the file needs to be downloaded. 
- **In the data table,** the view button (action section) at the right side once clicked needs to show the person's information in a pop-up/ separate page. 
- **In the data table,** the edit button (action section) at the right side, should go to the edit page for information updates. 
- **In the data table,** the delete button (action section) at the right side, should take user consent before deleting the row. 
- **In the data table,** age will be calculated from date of birth to current date.
